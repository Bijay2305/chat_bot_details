Step 1: Set Up Azure OpenAI Service
First, you need to get your API key and endpoint from the Azure OpenAI service. These will be used to access the GPT model.
Step 2: Set Up Azure Bot Service
You can create the bot service using the Azure Bot Framework. In this example, we’ll implement a basic bot that interacts with Azure OpenAI GPT-4 for answering customer queries.
Step 3: Python Code for the Chatbot

1. Install Required Libraries
pip install openai azure-cognitiveservices-botframework

2. Initialize the Bot and Connect it to Azure OpenAI
Below is an example of a simple customer support bot. It takes user input, sends it to the OpenAI API, and returns the generated response.
+++++++++++==

import openai
from azure.identity import DefaultAzureCredential
from azure.core.credentials import AzureKeyCredential
from azure.cognitiveservices.botframework import BotFrameworkClient

# Azure OpenAI API key and endpoint
openai.api_key = "YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY"
openai_endpoint = "https://YOUR_OPENAI_ENDPOINT"

# Azure Bot Service credentials
bot_service = BotFrameworkClient(endpoint="https://YOUR_BOT_SERVICE_ENDPOINT", credential=DefaultAzureCredential())

# Function to get a response from Azure OpenAI GPT-4
def get_gpt_response(user_input):
    response = openai.Completion.create(
        engine="gpt-4", # Choose the appropriate model
        prompt=user_input,
        max_tokens=150,
        temperature=0.7
    )
    return response['choices'][0]['text'].strip()

# Bot conversation flow
def customer_support_bot(user_input):
    # Process user input and generate a response using OpenAI GPT-4
    bot_response = get_gpt_response(user_input)

    # Return the bot's response
    return bot_response

# Example user query
user_query = "I want to return my product, how do I do that?"
response = customer_support_bot(user_query)
print(f"Bot: {response}")
+++++++++++++++=

3. Backend Interaction with Azure Functions
In customer support scenarios, you may need to retrieve specific information (e.g., order status, account details) from your backend systems. Azure Functions can handle these requests.

Here’s an example of how you can invoke an Azure Function within the bot to retrieve customer data:

import requests

# Azure Function URL
azure_function_url = "https://yourfunction.azurewebsites.net/api/GetOrderStatus"

def get_order_status(order_id):
    # Call the Azure Function with the order ID
    response = requests.get(f"{azure_function_url}?order_id={order_id}")
    if response.status_code == 200:
        return response.json()
    else:
        return {"error": "Unable to retrieve order status."}

# Example usage
order_id = "12345"
order_status = get_order_status(order_id)
print(f"Order Status: {order_status}")

Step 4: Human Handoff
When the bot encounters a situation it cannot handle, you can use a handoff mechanism to route the conversation to a human agent.
def customer_support_bot(user_input):
    # Define conditions for human handoff
    if "talk to agent" in user_input.lower():
        return "Please hold while I transfer you to a human agent."
    
    # Otherwise, generate a response using GPT-4
    bot_response = get_gpt_response(user_input)
    return bot_response


Step 5: Deploy the Bot
Deploy to Azure Bot Service: Once the code is ready, you can deploy the bot to Azure using the Azure CLI or the Azure portal.

Monitor: You can integrate Azure Monitor to track and log conversations, errors, and performance metrics.

Secure the Bot: Use Azure Key Vault to securely store sensitive information like API keys and credentials.

Step 6: Deploy Across Channels
Azure Bot Framework allows you to connect your bot to various channels like:

Websites using Direct Line API.
Microsoft Teams, Facebook Messenger, or WhatsApp for broader customer interaction.


++++++++++

o enhance the customer support chatbot by interacting with Cosmos DB for customer-specific data retrieval (e.g., retrieving order details, updating user profiles), we can integrate Azure Cosmos DB into the existing architecture.

Below is an extended example where the bot fetches customer information from Cosmos DB based on the user query.

Step 1: Set Up Cosmos DB
Create a Cosmos DB account via the Azure Portal (use the API for MongoDB, SQL, or any other as per your use case).
Get the connection string and credentials (account key, database, and collection name).
Step 2: Install Required Libraries

pip install azure-cosmos

Step 3: Python Code for Cosmos DB Interaction
1. Connect to Cosmos DB
You can connect to Cosmos DB using Python's Cosmos DB SDK to query data, update records, or perform CRUD operations.

import openai
from azure.cosmos import CosmosClient, exceptions

# Cosmos DB credentials
COSMOS_DB_ENDPOINT = "https://your-cosmos-account.documents.azure.com:443/"
COSMOS_DB_KEY = "your-cosmos-db-key"
DATABASE_NAME = "CustomerSupport"
CONTAINER_NAME = "CustomerData"

# Initialize the Cosmos client
cosmos_client = CosmosClient(COSMOS_DB_ENDPOINT, COSMOS_DB_KEY)
database = cosmos_client.get_database_client(DATABASE_NAME)
container = database.get_container_client(CONTAINER_NAME)

# Function to query customer data from Cosmos DB
def get_customer_order(order_id):
    try:
        # Query Cosmos DB for order details
        query = f"SELECT * FROM c WHERE c.order_id = '{order_id}'"
        items = list(container.query_items(query=query, enable_cross_partition_query=True))
        
        if items:
            return items[0]  # Assuming the first result is the correct order
        else:
            return {"error": "Order not found."}
    except exceptions.CosmosHttpResponseError as e:
        return {"error": f"Cosmos DB error: {str(e)}"}

# Example usage to retrieve order status
order_id = "12345"
order_data = get_customer_order(order_id)
print(f"Order Data: {order_data}")
++++++++++++

2. Integrating Cosmos DB in the Chatbot Workflow
You can now extend the bot to fetch customer-specific information based on the input from the user. Here’s an updated version of the chatbot function that interacts with Cosmos DB when the user asks for an order status.

import openai

# Azure OpenAI API key and endpoint
openai.api_key = "YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY"
openai_endpoint = "https://YOUR_OPENAI_ENDPOINT"

# Bot function to generate responses using GPT and fetch data from Cosmos DB
def customer_support_bot(user_input):
    # Check if the input relates to an order status query
    if "order status" in user_input.lower():
        # Extract order ID from user input (for simplicity, assume it's mentioned in the input)
        order_id = extract_order_id(user_input)
        
        # Fetch order data from Cosmos DB
        order_data = get_customer_order(order_id)
        
        if "error" not in order_data:
            # Return the order status to the user
            return f"Your order status is: {order_data['status']}. Expected delivery: {order_data['delivery_date']}."
        else:
            return f"Sorry, I couldn't retrieve your order details: {order_data['error']}"
    
    # Otherwise, generate a response using GPT-4 for general queries
    bot_response = openai.Completion.create(
        engine="gpt-4",
        prompt=user_input,
        max_tokens=150,
        temperature=0.7
    )
    
    return bot_response['choices'][0]['text'].strip()

# Helper function to extract order ID from user input
def extract_order_id(user_input):
    # Simple placeholder function to extract the order ID
    # In real-world scenarios, use NLP or regex to parse the input
    return "12345"  # Assume "12345" is the extracted order ID

# Example user query
user_query = "Can you check the status of my order 12345?"
response = customer_support_bot(user_query)
print(f"Bot: {response}")

Step 4: Deploying and Testing the Bot
Deploy the bot to Azure Bot Service as explained earlier.
Ensure that the Cosmos DB container has the correct customer information and order details (with fields like order_id, status, delivery_date, etc.).
Test the interaction by sending user queries such as:
"Can you check the status of my order 12345?"
The bot will respond by fetching the data from Cosmos DB and giving the order status.

Example Sequence:
User: "What's the status of my order 12345?"
Bot:
Extracts the order ID (12345).
Queries Cosmos DB for the order details.
If found, responds with the order status and delivery date.
If not found, responds with an error message.

with prompt 


The prompt plays a crucial role in the chatbot flow when using the Azure OpenAI Service (GPT-4) to generate conversational responses. Specifically, it is the input text (query or instruction) that the model uses to generate a response. In the context of the customer support chatbot integrating Cosmos DB for retrieving user-specific data, the prompt is utilized in these cases:

1. Initial User Query
When a customer interacts with the chatbot, they provide a query such as "What's the status of my order?" or "How can I return a product?"
This user query forms the prompt that is sent to the OpenAI model (GPT) for natural language understanding.
2. Cosmos DB Interaction
If the user query involves retrieving data from Cosmos DB (like order status or customer details), the bot first interprets the request using the prompt.
For example, in the code example provided earlier, the user query would be analyzed by GPT-4. Depending on the context, the bot may identify that the prompt contains an order-related query and initiate a Cosmos DB call to retrieve data.
3. Augmenting the Prompt with Factual Data
After querying Cosmos DB and retrieving information (such as order details), the bot can append this data to the prompt to further refine the response generated by GPT-4.
Example: The chatbot can send a prompt like:
"The order ID 12345 is currently being processed and will be delivered by October 15. How can I assist you further?"
The model then uses this prompt to generate an appropriate response based on both the user’s query and the Cosmos DB data.
4. Handling Conversational Context
Prompts can also maintain the context of the conversation by concatenating prior user messages and responses. This ensures that GPT-4 generates coherent and contextually relevant replies as the conversation continues.
Example Flow with Prompt:
User: "What’s the status of my order 12345?"
Bot: Uses the prompt ("What’s the status of order 12345?") to identify it as an order inquiry.
Bot: Queries Cosmos DB for the order details (order ID 12345).
Bot: Combines the retrieved information (e.g., "Your order will arrive on October 15.") with the original query.
Bot: Uses the new prompt ("Your order 12345 will arrive on October 15. Can I help you with anything else?") to generate a response.
Thus, the prompt comes into play at both the initial stage of understanding the user’s intent and when the bot needs to generate a meaningful, data-driven response.

Here's an example demonstrating how prompts work in a chatbot integrating Azure OpenAI GPT-4 with Cosmos DB for customer support.

This example covers:

Prompt Creation based on user input.
Fetching Data from Cosmos DB using an order ID.
Augmenting the Prompt with Cosmos DB data to provide a relevant response.
Steps in Code:
User Input is processed.
OpenAI GPT-4 is used to interpret the user's intent (e.g., asking for order status).
Cosmos DB is queried to fetch specific data.
A new prompt is generated combining both GPT’s response and the data from Cosmos DB.
Final Response is sent back to the user.
Code Example
1. Install Required Libraries
pip install openai azure-cosmos

2. Connecting to Azure Cosmos DB
Here we assume that the Cosmos DB is already set up with a container storing order data.
import openai
from azure.cosmos import CosmosClient

# Azure OpenAI API key
openai.api_key = "YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY"

# Cosmos DB credentials
COSMOS_DB_ENDPOINT = "https://your-cosmos-account.documents.azure.com:443/"
COSMOS_DB_KEY = "your-cosmos-db-key"
DATABASE_NAME = "CustomerSupport"
CONTAINER_NAME = "Orders"

# Initialize the Cosmos client
cosmos_client = CosmosClient(COSMOS_DB_ENDPOINT, COSMOS_DB_KEY)
database = cosmos_client.get_database_client(DATABASE_NAME)
container = database.get_container_client(CONTAINER_NAME)

# Function to query Cosmos DB for order status
def get_order_status(order_id):
    query = f"SELECT * FROM c WHERE c.order_id = '{order_id}'"
    items = list(container.query_items(query=query, enable_cross_partition_query=True))
    
    if items:
        return items[0]  # Return the first result (assuming unique order IDs)
    else:
        return None

# Example: Fetching order data from Cosmos DB
order_id = "12345"
order_data = get_order_status(order_id)
if order_data:
    print(f"Order Status: {order_data['status']}, Delivery Date: {order_data['delivery_date']}")
else:
    print("Order not found.")
    
3. Chatbot Logic with OpenAI and Cosmos DB Integration
The chatbot uses OpenAI GPT-4 to process general queries, but if the query involves an order status request, it fetches data from Cosmos DB and uses it to form a response.

def get_gpt_response(prompt):
    # Call OpenAI GPT-4 to generate a response based on the prompt
    response = openai.Completion.create(
        engine="gpt-4",
        prompt=prompt,
        max_tokens=150,
        temperature=0.7
    )
    return response['choices'][0]['text'].strip()

def customer_support_bot(user_input):
    # Check if the input relates to an order status query
    if "order status" in user_input.lower():
        # Extract order ID (this is simplified; real code should use NLP or regex)
        order_id = extract_order_id(user_input)  # For demo purposes, assume the function exists
        
        # Query Cosmos DB for the order status
        order_data = get_order_status(order_id)
        
        if order_data:
            # Use the retrieved data in the response
            order_status = order_data['status']
            delivery_date = order_data['delivery_date']
            
            # Augment the prompt with order status data
            prompt = f"The customer asked for the status of order {order_id}. The order status is '{order_status}' and the expected delivery date is {delivery_date}. Provide a helpful response."
        else:
            # If no data is found, generate an apology response
            prompt = f"The customer asked for the status of order {order_id}, but the order was not found in the database. Apologize and offer help."
        
        # Generate the final response using GPT
        final_response = get_gpt_response(prompt)
        return final_response
    
    # For other types of queries, just pass the user input to GPT directly
    else:
        return get_gpt_response(user_input)

# Example usage
user_query = "Can you check the status of my order 12345?"
response = customer_support_bot(user_query)
print(f"Bot: {response}")


Prompt's Role in Detail:
Initial Prompt: The user query (e.g., "What's the status of my order 12345?") is interpreted by GPT-4.
Augmented Prompt: After retrieving order details from Cosmos DB, the prompt is updated to include specific information like order status and delivery date. GPT-4 then uses this enhanced prompt to generate a more contextually accurate response.
Benefits of Using Cosmos DB:
Real-time data interaction: Fetch and update order information on the fly.
Scalable: Cosmos DB can handle vast amounts of customer data.
Flexibility: You can easily extend this model to support more use cases like customer profile updates, product queries, etc.
By using prompts in combination with real-time data from Cosmos DB, you create a dynamic and intelligent chatbot capable of personalized customer support.
